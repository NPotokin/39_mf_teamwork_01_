        Step into the paws of a determined panda
        on a mission to gather all food scattered
        throughout the land! Use the arrow keys to
        navigate your panda through challenging
        terrains, but beware – every pumpkin is
        fiercely guarded by a swift tiger that
        moves twice as fast and is eager to turn
        you into its next meal.
      </p>
      <p>
        To achieve the highest score, you must
        collect all food as quickly as possible
        while taking the fewest steps. Strategize
        your moves, outsmart the enemies, and
        embark on this thrilling adventure. Good
        luck on your journey, and may your panda's
        be victorious!
