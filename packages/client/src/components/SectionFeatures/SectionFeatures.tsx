        Step into the paws of a determined panda on a mission to gather all the
        pumpkins scattered throughout the land! Use the arrow keys to navigate
        your panda through challenging terrains, but beware – every pumpkin is
        fiercely guarded by a swift tiger that moves twice as fast and is eager
        to turn you into its next meal.
      </p>
      <p>
        To achieve the highest score, you must collect all the pumpkins as
        quickly as possible while taking the fewest steps. Strategize your
        moves, outsmart the tigers, and embark on this thrilling adventure. Good
        luck on your journey, and may your panda's quest be victorious!
