      <p>
        Step into the paws of a determined panda
        on a mission to gather all the pumpkins
        scattered throughout the land! Use the
        arrow keys to navigate your panda through
        challenging terrains, but beware â€“ every
        pumpkin is fiercely guarded by a swift
        tiger that moves twice as fast and is
        eager to turn you into its next meal.
      </p>
      <p>
        To achieve the highest score, you must
        collect all the pumpkins as quickly as
        possible while taking the fewest steps.
        Strategize your moves, outsmart the
        tigers, and embark on this thrilling
        adventure. Good luck on your journey, and
        may your panda's quest be victorious!
